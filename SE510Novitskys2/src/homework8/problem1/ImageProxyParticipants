ImageProxy Participants

ImageProxy:
	- Maintains a reference to real graphic Image.
	- Provides an interface identical to Graphic's so that an ImageProxy
	  can be substituted for Image.
	- Controls Tester's access to Image by only cloning an Image when 
	  changeColor() is called (Copy-on-Write).
	
Graphics:
	- Defines a common interface for Image and ImageProxy so that an
	  ImageProxy can be used anywhere an Image is expected.
	  
Image:
	- Defines the real object that ImageProxy represents.
	- Returns a deep clone of itself in order to separate it from
	  other images referencing the same location in memory.
