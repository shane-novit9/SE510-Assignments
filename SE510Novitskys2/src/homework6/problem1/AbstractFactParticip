Abstract Factory Participants

Body.java, Engine.java, and Wheel.java all serve as interfaces for the families of objects
produced in the abstract factory.

FordBody.java, FordEngine.java, and FordWheel.java represent the Ford family of concrete 
product implementations.
GMBody.java, GMEngine.java, and GMWheel.java represent the GM family of concrete 
product implementations.

PartsFactory.java defines the interface for the factory that returns car parts.

FordPartFactory.java is a concrete factory that produces parts of the Ford family.
GMPartFactory.java is a concrete factory that produces parts of the GM family.

CarShowroom.java is the client that only depends on the body, engine, wheel, and partsFactory 
interfaces.

CarTypeSelector.java serves as the driver, creating a concrete parts factory and passing it to
CarShowroom via injection. 

CarShowroom.java asks a subclass of PartsFactory.java to create a concrete body, engine, or 
wheel.
