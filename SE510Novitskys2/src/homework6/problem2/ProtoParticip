Prototype Participants

Body.java, Engine.java, and Wheel.java are prototypes that define the clone operation.

FordBody.java, GMBody.java, FordEngine.java, GMEngine.java, FordWheel.java, and GMWheel.java
are all concrete objects implementing prototypes. They can return clones of themselves.

CarShowroom.java is a client that can obtain more bodies, engines, or wheels by asking them to
clone themselves respectively.

CarShowroom.java is a collaboration because it asks the body, engine, and wheel prototypes to 
clone themselves for a concrete implementation of that prototype.
