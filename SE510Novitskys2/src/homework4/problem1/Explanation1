Prior to the modifications I made to FancyBlogBrowser(FBB) it was reliant on not only the blog and blogSource classes,
but also each subclass of blogSource(MySQLBS, CsvBS). This meant that when adding a PostgreSQLBlogSource a programmer would need to
modify code within FBB to account for the expansion(Violation of OCP). Also, a new driver was made for each type of blogSource which 
is redundant.

To make it so that any number of blog sources can be added to the program without having to make any changes in FBB I turned blogSource 
into an abstract interface. This way FBB need only have a blogSource attribute rather than having to discern what type of database its 
accessing. Individual blog sources, i.e. MySQLBS, PgSQLBS, etc, are implementations of blogSource that override blog source's methods. 

In FBBDriver, a blogSource attribute is defined with individual blog sources being passed to it. Dependency injection via setter in the 
form of the setBlogSource(BlogSource) method allows the driver to change databases at runtime.
