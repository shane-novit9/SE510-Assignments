The main issue I found with the BlogSite program was that the service interface was responsible for the creation, deletion, and updating of 
accounts, blogs, and comments meaning the interface was in violation of the single responsibility principle. To resolve this issue, I implemented
the interface segregation principle. I created individual services for accounts, blogs, and comment along with individual implementations of those 
services. I then created the BlogSite class to serve as a sort of driver declaring the three types of services, assigning instantiations of services' 
respective implementation to those services, and finally call method1 within each controller to test each service.
