To make toaster independent of any implementation of toast I first created the ToastFactory interface that defines the createToast method. Then, in
Toaster.java I declared a private ToastFactory and a constructor with ToastFactory being the type of the formal parameter. In the collectToast
method within Toaster I replaced "Toast toast = new BasicToast();" with "Toast toast = ToastFactory.createToast();" making toaster independent of any
toast implementation. Finally, in the Driver class I declared a ToastFactory and, depending on what body of the if else statement is executed, assign 
the proper implementation of ToastFactory to it. Followed by assigning toaster an instance of toaster with tf (ToastFactory) being passed to the 
constructor.
