Command Participants

Command declared an interface for executing operations.

Bark, Meow, and Moo are Concrete Commands that define a binding between
ToyGUI and the action of making their respective animal noise. Implements
execute to let ToyGUI know what image and sound are selected as well as
tell ToyGUI to speak once it has the proper data.

Toy serves as the Application, defining all Concrete Commands and binding 
them to their respective AnimalButton. Sends user requests to 
Invoker(AnimalButton) or Menu(NameTextBox).

TextBox is an Abstract Menu Class defining an interface for Concrete Menus.

NameTextBox is a Concrete Menu that stores Invokers with names tied to them
via HashMap. If the String entered by the user matches one of the keys in the
HashMap it tells the Invoker associated with that String to execute.

Button is an Abstract Invoker Class defining an interface for Concrete
Invokers. 

AnimalButton serves as an Invoker. It stores a command and executes it when
the button is clicked.

ToyGUI serves as the receiver. It knows how to perform the operations
(setSound, setImage, and speak) associated with a request.
