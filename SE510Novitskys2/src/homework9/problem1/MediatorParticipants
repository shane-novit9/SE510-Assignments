Mediator Participants

DialogDirector is the mediator that defines an interface for communicating
with Widget objects.

FontDialogDirector servers as the concrete mediator, it knows and maintains 
its Widgets. When a widget is changed FontDialogDirector is notified and 
makes subsequent changes to other Widgets if necessary.

ListBox is a Widget that maintains a list of the available fonts as well as
the selection of these fonts. When a new font is selected, 
FontDialogDirector is notified and passes the selected font to EntryField.

EntryField is a Widget that holds the font currently being used. When a new
font is set, FontDialogDirector is notified and enables/ disables buttons
associated with that particular font.

RadioButtonList is a Widget that stores Buttons representing variations of a
particular font. When a new font is selected, FontDialogDirector tells 
RadioButtonList to enable/disable variations based off what font is selected.

Cancel is a button Widget that is always enabled.

OK is a button Widget that is enables when a font is selected and disabled
otherwise.
