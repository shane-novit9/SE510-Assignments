# SE510-Assignments

  This repository is a collection of assignements I have completed for the University of Scranton's SE510 course (Applications/ Principles of Software Design). 
Assignments 4-9 were intended to test or knowledge of multiple creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns. Assignment 10 is a simple assignment given 
to my classmates and I to introduce us to domain-logic design patterns.
